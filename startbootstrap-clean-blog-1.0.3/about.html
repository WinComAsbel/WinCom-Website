					<strong> Mission </strong>
					<p>The mission of WiNCom is to develop a deep understanding of RF spectrum utilization, use that understanding to
					inform spectrum policy and motivate and support the development innovative techniques to use spectrum more efficiently.
					</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="goal">
					<strong>Goals</strong>
					<p>Our goal is to increase the access to the RF spectrum for all, and increase spectrum utilization and efficiency.
					This goal will be achieved by combining analytic models, system simulations, and experimental measurements 
					so as to fully utilize the three dimensional wireless network space in the face of increasing interference.
					</p>
					
					</div>
					
					<div class="program">
					<strong> Programs </strong> 
					<p> Research programs include RF spectrum measurements, RF measurement data storage and analysis techniques;
					cognitive radio; RF coexistence; and RF interference modeling and mitigation, with applications 
					in licensed/unlicensed spectrum, public safety, and spectrum sharing.
					</p>
							
					</div>
					
					
					<div class="motivation">
					<strong> Motivation </strong>
					<p> The availability of sufficient RF spectrum for innovative services such as the mobile and fixed wireless internet access is a driver of national competitiveness and economic growth. The demand for radio frequency (RF)
					spectrum by wireless carriers, private enterprises, the DOD, non-DOD federal users, and state and local government, continues to increase. Conservative estimates of wireless data traffic growth range from 10x to 20x for the period 2009-2014. Government and industry sources agree that significant additional RF spectrum for both licensed and unlicensed uses is required to meet this demand. In recognition of the accelerating need for more spectrum, the President's 2010 National Broadband Plan called for 500 MHz of additional spectrum to be made available for broadband wireless by 2020. The June 2012 report of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) calls for the identification of 1000 MHz of Federal Spectrum to be shared with private (commercial) users.
					Since the RF spectrum usable for wireless services has already been allocated to specific uses and service categories, the only options available to secure this spectrum are to a) increase the efficiency of current spectrum use via new technology; b) re-purpose spectrum from one use to another; and c) institute spectrum sharing in bands that are currently assigned exclusively to a single user or usage category.
					It is against this backdrop that IIT's Wireless Network and Research Center seeks to increase RF spectrum utilization and efficiency via research in RF spectrum measurements, RF measurement data storage and analysis techniques; cognitive radio; RF coexistence; wireless network modeling; and RF interference modeling and mitigation.

					<div class="history">
					<strong>History</strong>
					<p>
					Founded in 2006 by Cynthia Hood, Associate Professor and Assistant Chair, Computer Science Department, and Dennis Roberson, IIT Vice Provost, New Initiatives and Research Professor, Computer Science Department, the Wireless Network Communications Research Center (WiNCom) 
					is interdisciplinary and fuses the creative talents of the ECE and CSCI departments as well as researchers across IIT.
					</p>
					
					</div>
						
					
					<div class="tech">
					<strong>Technology Transfer</strong>
					<p> The Center has generated numerous technology transfers and spinoffs, including a commercial RF spectrum observatory network. Center researchers have ongoing engagements with the FCC 
					and other government entities including the U.S. Commerce Department Spectrum Management Advisory Committee.
